								<h3>What makes us great at this</h3>
								<p>For the last decade, Just Your Bag planners have visited over 30 countries across 4 continents. When time (or money) is short we explore closer destinations here in the US. We haven't been EVERYWHERE, but we know how to travel like pros and, more importantly, we know how to find destinations that will be truly amazing.</p>

								<p>On a personal level, we enjoy travel that takes us to places off the beaten path. Local bars of all styles are a particular interest, as a few of us on the team are home brewers. We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE street food and eating on the cheap but know how to appreciate a fine dining experience when the occasion calls for it. Give us a trail to ride, river to raft or a mountain to climb and we'll be happy till long after sunset. We've shopped for antique pins in Hong Kong, purses in Paris and books in London. That's just a small peek into how we travel but maybe you'll inspire us to discover something new.</p>

								<h3>We don't do everything</h3>
								<p>We know our strengths and weaknesses which is why we do not offer flight, hotel or transportation arrangements. There are far better resources out there than Just Your Bag for these needs and you'll be far better off with them.</p>

								<p>We do not see ourselves as tour guides, not in the traditional sense anyway. That said, if you like history, monuments or museums you should consider taking the time while you travel and enlist a professional guide who can fill that need for you. We will be honest with you from the beginning if we don't feel as though we can have a positive effect on your trip. </p>
